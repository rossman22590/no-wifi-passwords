## No More Wifi Passwords
 
This is a fun project to get rid of wifi passwords so we never have to remember them again. I took big inspiration from [qrGpt repo](https://github.com/Nutlope/qrGPT) that had a lot of the basics already set up (this repo is forked from it)

Generate wifi qr codes so you never have to memorize or pass long strings to your guests ever again
